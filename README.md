Systers Portal - VMS project
==============

[![Code Issues](http://www.quantifiedcode.com/api/v1/project/7c33146f345842028664a5e8fec5e8d6/badge.svg)](http://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/project/7c33146f345842028664a5e8fec5e8d6)


Systers has many volunteers and potential volunteers that offer their skills, time and commitment to our vision. This **Volunteer Management System** will be particularly useful for volunteer coordinators, volunteer sign-up, tracking hours, and reporting.

Features
--------

The scope of the VMS is defined in phases with the initial implementation to track volunteers contact information, track hours, and reporting. There are also different user scenarios that must be addressed: 
1. administrator
2. user/volunteer
3. reporting.

**The project is under active development now**. [Current developer](http://systers.org/systers-dev/doku.php/valeria_bogdanova).
