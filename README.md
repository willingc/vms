Systers Portal - VMS project
============================

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/qubyte/rubidium.svg)](https://github.com/willingc/vms/tree/v0.2.0)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vms/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vms/?badge=latest)

Systers has many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to
our vision and projects. The **Volunteer Management System** (VMS) will
be useful for volunteer coordinators, volunteer sign-up, tracking hours, and 
reporting.

**This project is under active development.**

additional detail on the project's scope.
